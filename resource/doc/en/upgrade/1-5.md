# 1.5 Upgrade Guide

**Before upgrading, please make sure to backup and execute the following commands to upgrade**
`composer require workerman/webman-framework ^1.5 -W && composer require webman/console ^1.2.12 && php webman install`

# Feature Changes

Support for Workerman v5 [coroutines](https://www.workerman.net/doc/workerman/fiber.html)

> **Note**
> Workerman v5 requires PHP>=8.1
> Upgrading Workerman: `composer require workerman/workerman ^5.0.0 -W`
> Installation of Fiber coroutine required: `composer require revolt/event-loop ^1.0.0`

# Examples

### Delayed Response

```php
<?php

namespace app\controller;

use support\Request;
use Workerman\Timer;

class TestController
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        // Sleep for 1.5 seconds
        Timer::sleep(1.5);
        return $request->getRemoteIp();
    }
}
```
`Timer::sleep()` is similar to the built-in `sleep()` function in PHP, the difference being that `Timer::sleep()` does not block the process.

### Initiating HTTP Requests

> **Note**
> Requires installation of: `composer require workerman/http-client ^2.0.0`

```php
<?php

namespace app\controller;

use support\Request;
use Workerman\Http\Client;

class TestController
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        static $client;
        $client = $client ?: new Client();
        $response = $client->get('http://example.com'); // Initiating an asynchronous request using a synchronous method
        return $response->getBody()->getContents();
    }
}
```
Similarly, the `$client->get()` request is non-blocking and can be used in Webman to handle HTTP requests asynchronously, thus improving performance.

For more information, refer to [workerman/http-client](https://www.workerman.net/doc/workerman/components/workerman-http-client.html)

### Addition of `support\Context` class

The `support\Context` class is used to store data related to requests, and the corresponding context data will be automatically deleted upon request completion. This means that the context data lifecycle follows the request lifecycle.

### Global Variable Contamination

The coroutine environment prohibits storing **request-related** state information in global or static variables, as this could lead to contamination of global variables, for example:

```php
<?php

namespace app\controller;

use support\Request;
use Workerman\Timer;

class TestController
{
    protected static $name = '';

    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        static::$name = $request->get('name');
        Timer::sleep(5);
        return static::$name;
    }
}
```

Setting the number of processes to 1, when continuously making two requests:
http://127.0.0.1:8787/test?name=lilei
http://127.0.0.1:8787/test?name=hanmeimei
We expect the results of the two requests to be `lilei` and `hanmeimei` respectively, but in fact, they both return `hanmeimei`.
This is because the static variable `$name` is overridden by the second request, and when the sleep of the first request ends, the static variable `$name` has already become `hanmeimei`.

**The correct approach is to use context to store request state data**
```php
<?php

namespace app\controller;

use support\Request;
use support\Context;
use Workerman\Timer;

class TestController
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        Context::set('name', $request->get('name'));
        Timer::sleep(5);
        return Context::get('name');
    }
}
```

**Local variables do not cause data contamination**
```php
<?php

namespace app\controller;

use support\Request;
use support\Context;
use Workerman\Timer;

class TestController
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        $name = $request->get('name');
        Timer::sleep(5);
        return $name;
    }
}
```
Because `$name` is a local variable, coroutines cannot access local variables between each other, so using local variables is coroutine-safe.

# About Coroutines
Coroutines are not a silver bullet; introducing coroutines means paying attention to global variable/static variable contamination issues and setting the context. Also, debugging bugs in coroutine environment is more complex than in blocking programming.

In reality, Webman's blocking programming is already fast enough. According to the last three rounds' benchmark data from [techempower.com](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r21&l=zijnjz-6bj&test=db&f=1ekg-cbcw-2t4w-27wr68-pc0-iv9slc-0-1ekgw-39g-kxs00-o0zk-4fu13d-2x8do8-2), in terms of database business, Webman's blocking programming is nearly twice as performant as Go's web frameworks Gin, Echo, etc., and nearly 40 times as performant as traditional frameworks like Laravel.

When the database, Redis, etc., are all within the intranet, the performance of multi-process blocking programming may often be higher than that of coroutines, as the overhead of coroutine creation, scheduling, and destruction may be greater than the overhead of process switching when the database, Redis, etc., are fast enough. Therefore, introducing coroutines at this point may not significantly improve performance.

# When to Use Coroutines
When there are slow accesses in business, e.g., when the business needs to access third-party interfaces, asynchronous HTTP calls can be made using [workerman/http-client](https://www.workerman.net/doc/workerman/components/workerman-http-client.html) in a coroutine manner, thus enhancing application concurrency.
